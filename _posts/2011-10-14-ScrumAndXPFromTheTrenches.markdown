Amazon was nice enough to send me _Scrum and XP from the Trenches_ the other day...mostly because I clicked all the buttons and bought it.

It showed up at work Wednesday afternoon. I thumbed through a few pages and threw it in my backpack. When I got home, I thumbed through a few more pages and set it on the end table. It seemed like a decent read, but I didn't have time just yet. After all, the MLB playoffs are in full swing, so my evenings are pretty much spoken for...

Fast forward to a little after 04:00 Thursday morning. After an exciting case of driving across the township to have an Alzheimer's patient swing a hammer at me (I lead a secret double life as a volunteer firefighter), I was wide awake and sitting on my couch. I picked up the new book and read half of it before I realized that I had been reading for two hours and it was time to get moving for the morning.

Thursday evening, I managed to read the other half while lamenting the poor performance of the Rangers in their assigned duties of beating Detroit.

_Scrum and XP from the Trenches_ is an excellent read. Henrik Kniberg obviously cares about making his scrum teams excellent and has taken time to share what they've learned. It's not a how-to book so much, and I suspect that anyone who uses it as such will be disappointed. It's a war story (or a collection of war stories). It's a "how-WE-do-it, your mileage may vary, but if you picked up a book looking for advice, here it is..." kind of thing.

I picked it up mostly because I will soon be "off on assignment" living the Scrum & XP lifestyle and I wanted to get my head around some war story kind of stuff to have as pointers for where to go when specific thing X seems to be going not quite right. I think it served that purpose well. Many of the book's sections are called "How we do {something I'll probably have to do sometime in the next 18 months}".

Henrik doesn't claim that he's telling you how to do Scrum & XP. He claims he's telling you how his teams do Scrum & XP with commentary on what works for them and what doesn't. He even throws in some "if we get a chance to do it again, we'll probably try {idea here}" kind of stuff. I suppose one would have to do some serious digging to find out if his teams have been successful doing what he describes, but the forewords and references to the book on the web seem to indicate that his teams and the companies that he's worked with have been successful.

I'd say that if you're interested in or currently trying Scrum and(/or) XP, there's probably something in here that you can take away. And, it's a very quick read, so what do you have to lose? (Plus, it doesn't have nearly as many typos or formatting errors as [that little blue scrum book](http://www.netobjectives.com/files/LAPG/LAPG_ScrumTeamsOnline800x600.pdf) that everyone loves and I can never remember the name of...)

Oh, and if you made it this far you win a prize...[you can read the PDF free.] (http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/scrum-xp-from-the-trenches). (Or, come borrow my print copy.)
