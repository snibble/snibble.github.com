It's another Friday night and I ain't got nobody...

(apologies to Steven Georgiou)

It's possible that the coolest side project of my life started to take shape last evening.

[![](/static/xystage.jpg)](/static/xystage.jpg)

I have admired the [makerbot](http://www.makerbot.com) [cupcake](http://wiki.makerbot.com/cupcake) from afar for a while. It always seemed just geeky enough and just robotic enough to capture my interest. However, I had seen some of the first prints off of one in the early days and decided I'd be more frustrated than pleased with the quality. I couldn't see ever being able to print anything useful if everything was blocky and misshapen like the prints I saw. It seemed like the 3-d equivalent of a cocktail napkin sketch.

Evidently, I was wrong...or the prints I saw came from a poorly configured machine. (Or the intervening couple of years and the newer extruder heads that are now available made a ton of difference.)

A couple of weeks ago, [@wjsteele](http://twitter.com/wjsteele) presented at a meeting of [Indy ALT.NET](http://indyalt.net/cms/). His presentation was a show and tell of his makerbot cupcake. It was a thing of beauty. (Thanks, Bill! You turned me back on to the project.) Some of Bill's prints were still a little rough. But, some of them showed incredible potential, especially the nicely meshing helical gear set he brought. Suddenly, I could see actually using some of the things that a cupcake could print for more than curiosities and tchotchkes.

Fast forward a week or so, and we get to the time when it starts to sink in that in a few short weeks, I'll be taking a temporary work assignment in Des Moines, Iowa...for November and December...

Now, I understand that Des Moines is beautiful in late autumn/early winter. (And a recent quick reconnoissance trip showed me that it's nice in early fall, at least.) But, I bet I still have a bit of free time to spend sitting and staring at the walls of a hotel room. So, why not spend at least some of that time staring at a 3-d printer spitting out tchotchkes?

So, after a couple of weeks of collecting pieces and parts from [here](http://store.makerbot.com/cupcake-cnc-hardware-burrito.html), [there](https://sdp-si.com/eStore/), and [everywhere](http://www.ponoko.com/design-your-own/products/cupcake-cnc-chassis-designs-4246) (the original cupcakes are all sold out, but as an open-source project, the details are all out there for the adventurous to recreate), I finally today got enough parts in hand to start bolting things together. The picture that captured your attention above is the x/y axes of what will become my very own cupcake over the next couple of months. I had originally thought I'd just gather the parts and wait to start building and tweaking the robot once I get to Iowa. But it's evidently impossible to let robot parts sit idle after they reach critical mass of having enough parts to start the build. So, tonight after work, I built. 

I really only had one minor issue. Apparently the plywood my cupcake will soon be made of is so strong that even LASERS! can't always be counted on to cut through it.

But, a little work with a good sharp knife, and I was back in business building. And probably for several nights after work in the near future, I'll build again.

(Note to self: find NEMA 17 steppers or there isn't much else to build...)

Maybe by the time I get back to the mother-ship in 2012, I'll be well versed in taking some [super cool hair-brained idea](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12460) and making it tangible. Maybe I'll be able to build all those [little plastic pieces](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8157) that it seems we embedded systems guys need late at night in the lab. Maybe I'll just print [plastic crap](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11825) to fill our desks up with.

Stay tuned to find out!
