I don't have time...

...to worry about politics...but I care about the future of our nation
...for an exercise regimine...but I care about my health
...to read all the books I want to...but I can make a list and get started
...for all the conversations that I want to have...but I'll make time for most of them
...to cook a delicious and healthy meal every evening...but let's shoot for three nights a week
...to play games with my kids as much as I should...but we do alright
...for travelling the entire world...but I'm making plans to visit the interesting parts
...to listen to all the new music I'd like to hear...but I have friends that recommend good stuff
...to write as often as I should...but I could spit something out once in a while
...to clean the spare bedroom...but...well...hmmmm...I can at least close the door
...for fishing with my father-in-law three times a week...but I could start with twice a year
...to listen to every story my grandfather has to tell...but I want to hear all of them
...to learn to play the piano...but I can hunt and peck a few tunes
...to be a coach and a den leader and a firefighter and a board member and...and...but I can lend a hand when asked
...to take online courses in statistics and physics and javascript...but I can pick one to be first

I don't have time for perfection...but I have time to try.
