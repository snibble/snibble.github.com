The [49th parallel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/49th_parallel_north) is notable to people west of the Great Lakes. The [45th parallel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/45th_parallel_north) is something of a notable line, being halfway between the Equator and the North Pole. There's no arguing that the [38th parallel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/38th_parallel_north) has received some press.

But, I don't think the 40th parallel has any real claim to fame...until this week. Last Monday, a small crew of intrepid engineers from [SEP](http://www.sep.com) started a work assignment above the 40th parallel. For piles of business reasons, I can't get very detailed about the assignment. But, I can say that it's going to be exciting. 

I'm sure I'll have plenty to say about how things develop in coming weeks. For now, though, I'm most interested in comparing and contrasting the work we've done at SEP for years (always very slightly under the 40th parallel) with the work our merry band will be doing in the near future for a new client (a touch over the 40th parallel).

Now, having said that, the work over the 40th parallel has just begun. So, the comparison in earnest will have to wait. Six engineers have packed up, headed west (and north), and found themselves firmly ensconced in an extended-stay hotel in Des Moines. What we've learned so far is that the concierge, Luis, is an artist with an omelette pan, the people at Super Target might be tired of seeing us already, according to Charles, "Angry is a flavor", and the internet connection here apparently runs through a very narrow pipe somewhere.

We've had just enough time for the IT department to bless us with some underpowered laptops on which we have set up virtualized linux development systems using Qt, mercurial, Code Collaborator, and a spiff [distributed build system](http://en.opensuse.org/Icecream). Supposedly, we've made it onto "the short list" to get our actual development workstations, maybe next week. (Interestingly, the delay seems to center around getting solid-state drives ordered and installed, which is de rigueur for developers here.)

We've also spent quality time embedding with another scrum team, learning all we can about the code, the processes, the product, the people, the politics... That's probably a journey rather than a destination. But, we're getting a good start.

So, how's this all fit with our "under the 40th parallel" experience base? Pretty well.

We've always been a company who cares about relationships and what we have come to call "Discovery". We want to get to know our clients. We want to understand their systems and processes. We want to hear what their _real_ pain is. We want to sit down side-by-side with them and help solve their problems. We want to be able to help them with whatever comes up, because we understand how it fits in the big picture. We want to develop relationships with them that carry on after any given project is completed.

We're building that kind of relationship here over the 40th parallel. (Plus, we're getting to work with some really cool technologies to create some more really cool technologies.) In fact, between the last paragraph and this one, I got interrupted by a call telling me that one of the team members we've been working with this week just called and wants to get together for coffee this morning and maybe give us some ideas about things to do downtown this weekend. So, I'll consider that as good a reason as any to stop rambling and post...

(Stay tuned for more updates from somewhere over the 40th parallel...)
