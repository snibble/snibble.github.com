All I want for Christmas is Thanksgiving back!

Maybe it's just me, but is Thanksgiving moving the direction of Flag Day, Presidents' Day, and Columbus Day? (Quick, can you even name the month in which those holidays happen?) See, I like holidays that are about family and tradition and good times over holidays that are about consumerism and stress and depression.  

In my family, Thanksgiving has always been a big deal. Typical attendance at Mom's Thanksgiving lunch/dinner is around 50 family members. It's much like a lot of families' annual reunions (though, we have one of those too). My Great Aunt brings noodles that we all fight over. I deep fry a turkey. My aunt and I stand and mash potatoes until our fingers are scalded and raw. Mom and Dad make these amazing yeast rolls. Tens of cousins and other assorted relatives make fantastic casseroles and salads. Someone usually decides they're tired of turkey and shows up with an incredible lasagna or similar... Then we all gather, eat, visit, reminisce, plot, laugh, love, and catch up.

There are usually surprise guests too. This year, it was a distant cousin with a new family her son had married into since last Thanksgiving. They were welcomed like old frineds, fed, introduced, quizzed, harrassed, and folded into the family. I suspect they'll be back for years to come.

All the while, the TV networks have been prepping us for either the best or worst Christmas shopping season in years. Black Friday and Cyber Monday have been discussed and analyzed and prognosticated to the nth degree. Stores put up Christmas displays shortly after Labor Day. Amazon and other online retailers have been barraging us with emails about free shipping and 1% discounts on stuff we never would have bought anyway. Grandparents have been harassing us for wish lists since Halloween. But, nobody has been thinking about Thanksgiving.
