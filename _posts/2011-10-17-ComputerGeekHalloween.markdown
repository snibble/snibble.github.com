A recent running joke around [the office](http://www.sep.com) has been that we should all dress up as our favorite <del>geek</del>computer industry luminary. I think [DHH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Heinemeier_Hansson) came up as an example, but I don't remember who we assigned that role. [Zed Shaw](http://zedshaw.com) came up too, but no one could figure out how to get that many expletives into one costume. Other names got tossed around, but no really stand-out costume ideas materialized. In general, the idea kinda fell flat when we realized that we all know these people through their works and not their appearance.

Sure, [Jobs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs) had his iconic black turtleneck. And [Stallman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) has the beard (and the extra fingers for running Emacs). But, if I asked you to make me a [Matz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto) costume or an [Uncle Bob](http://www.objectmentor.com/omTeam/martin_r.html) costume, could you even get started?

So, who cares? Well, _we_ might. (No, not because we're still looking for costume ideas.) Maybe it's more accurate to say that "future we" might. When we get old and we're trying to reminisce or teach our grandchildren about the giants upon whose shoulders we stood, what will the monuments that we go visit look like?

I guess maybe not all is lost. After all, you can name this monument, right?
