The good folks at Applebee's have made a pretty good name for themselves in the casual dining business as "your neighborhood grill and bar". Their website details the myriad ways they think of themselves as a good neighbor. I haven't been in an Applebee's in a while, but I don't think I've ever had a bad experience in one (and I've certainly had some good/excellent experiences there). So, I guess I'm on board with their "neighborhood" marketing.

What would "your neighborhood software developers" look like?

I think they'd _care_. They'd care about solving problems. They'd care about solving _the right_ problems. They'd care about solving problems in _new and innovative ways_. They'd care about solving problems in _sustainable_ ways. They'd care about making damned sure _the problems are actually solved_. They'd care about following up to make sure the problems _stay solved_. They'd care about staying ahead of the crowd and learning ways to solve _the problems you won't even bring up until next year_. They'd care about solving problems for people who _desperately need help, but can't find it_.

I think they'd be _fun_. They'd be fun _to work with_. They'd be fun to _solve problems with_. They'd be fun _as individuals and as a group_. They'd be fun _in their community_. They'd be fun _just to hang out and have a beer with_.

I think they'd be _good at what they do_ and _know when to lean on other neighbors_.

I think they'd _be curious and willing to share openly_. They'd _go to conferences_. They'd _speak at conferences_. They'd _host outside speakers_. They'd _seek out the best in the industry and learn from them_. They'd _devour books and magazines (and blogs and podcasts and...)_ looking for any nugget that could make them better in the sort-term _and_ the long-term.

I think they'd _be nearby when needed_. They'd establish working and learning relationships with others _in their neighborhood_. They'd figure out ways to _seem nearby_ even when they're not. They'd come visit and _sit right down next to you_ if that's what it takes to get the job done.

I'm sure there are another 1.21 gigaways that your neighborhood software developers would be good neighbors. Some are more important than others, some are more achievable than others. These are just the ones that come to my mind first. Let's go out and try to do these and any others that come up.
